        <p>Japan, as an island nation in East Asia, is bordered by several major powers across the sea. The United States governs several Pacific islands close to Japan, and China is on the other side of the East China Sea. South Korea is about 30 miles away across the Korean Strait. Russian territory lies to the north in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. Japan has sometimes cooperated and sometimes fought wars with these countries in its modern history.</p>
        
        <p>For more than 40 years, Japan's Cabinet Office has conducted an annual public opinion poll on foreign policy, asking Japanese citizens whether they feel familiarity with the United States, China, South Korea, and Russia. The results show that Japanese public sentiment toward foreign countries is influenced by international relations, security, and political systems. In addition, perhaps economic and cultural forces are also altering attitudes.</p>
        
        <p>The latest 2022 survey results show a significant change from the previous year in the degree of familiarity with the two countries, South Korea and Russia.</p>

        <p>45.9% of respondents reported feeling familiarity with South Korea, up 8.9 percentage points from the 2021 survey. Japan and South Korea are at odds over history, territory, and trade, and are rivals in manufacturing, such as automobiles and electronics, and in soccer and baseball. In recent years, relations have deteriorated due to issues such as individual compensation for the period of Japanese colonial rule.</p>
        <p>Since Yun Seok-yeol took office as President of South Korea in 2022, political relations between the two countries have been improving. Both Japan and South Korea, allies of the U.S., face the threat of North Korea's nuclear and missile development and China's military buildup. This has also affected the Japanese public's sense of affinity toward South Korea.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, the percentage of respondents who feel "familiar" with Russia dropped 8.1 points to a record low of 5%. This is likely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. Japan, along with the U.S. and EU countries, is participating in sanctions against Russia.</p>
        <p>Japan was at the forefront of the former Soviet threat in the Far East, much like Germany was in Europe during the Cold War. Japan and Russia still do not have a World War II peace treaty. The level of friendship between these two countries, which were low to begin with, were further exacerbated by the conflict over Ukraine.</p>
        
        <p>In this latest survey, the results about the U.S. and China did not change significantly. The U.S., as Japan's only military ally, remains the country with which the Japanese people feel the closest affinity. For the Japanese people, China remained the second least friendly country after Russia.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at the changes of the surveys over the past 40 years or so, it appears that as authoritarian tendencies have increased, familiarity with the country has tended to decline.</p>
        <p>About 40 years ago, Japanese familiarity with China was on par with that of the U.S, but the gap with the U.S. widened around the time of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. By 2012, when Xi Jinping took office as supreme leader of China, the percentage of respondents who felt familiarity with China fell below 20%. </p>

          </script>
        </div>

        <p>When looking at the breakdown of the survey, such as generation and gender, non-political factors also come to mind.</p>
        <p>Views of two East Asian countries, China and South Korea, differ by generation. Those in their 30s and younger say they feel more familiar with these countries than do older generations. When the 40+ generation was young, Japan was far ahead of these two countries in economic power. Now in the 21st century, the gap between the three East Asian countries in manufacturing and IT technology, etc. is not so large. For the younger generation, China and South Korea are not lagging behind; rather, they are economic partners of Japan.</p>

        <p>As for South Korea, nearly two-thirds of respondents under age 30 say they are familiar with the country. Younger generations in Japan are more familiar with Korean culture, including K-pop, than older generations.There are also gender differences with regard to Korea. Female respondents are 13 points more familiar with Korea than male respondents. Korean fashion and TV dramas are popular among Japanese women, suggesting that cultural exchange has an impact on national sentiment.</p>
