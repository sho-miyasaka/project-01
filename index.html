        <p>Japan, as an island nation in East Asia, is bordered by several major powers across the sea. The United States governs several Pacific islands close to Japan, and China is on the other side of the East China Sea. South Korea is about 30 miles away across the Korean Strait. Russian territory lies to the north in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. Japan has sometimes cooperated and sometimes fought wars with these countries in its modern history.</p>
        
        <p>For more than 40 years, Japan's Cabinet Office has conducted an annual public opinion poll on foreign policy, asking Japanese citizens whether they feel familiarity with the United States, China, South Korea, and Russia. The results show that Japanese public sentiment toward foreign countries is influenced by international relations, security, and political systems. In addition, perhaps economic and cultural forces are also altering attitudes.</p>
        
        <p>The latest 2022 survey results show a significant change from the previous year in the degree of familiarity with the two countries, South Korea and Russia.</p>

        <p>45.9% of respondents reported feeling familiarity with South Korea, up 8.9 percentage points from the 2021 survey. Japan and South Korea are at odds over history, territory, and trade, and are rivals in manufacturing, such as automobiles and electronics, and in soccer and baseball. In recent years, relations have deteriorated due to issues such as individual compensation for the period of Japanese colonial rule.</p>
        <p>Since Yun Seok-yeol took office as President of South Korea in 2022, political relations between the two countries have been improving. This has also affected the Japanese public's sense of affinity toward South Korea.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, the percentage of respondents who feel "familiar" with Russia dropped 8.1 points to a record low of 5%. This is likely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. Japan, along with the U.S. and EU countries, is participating in sanctions against Russia.</p>
        <p>Japan was at the forefront of the former Soviet threat in the Far East, much like Germany was in Europe during the Cold War. Japan and Russia still do not have a World War II peace treaty. Friendship, which was low to begin with, was further exacerbated by the conflict over Ukraine.</p>
        
        <p>The United States and China showed no significant change in the latest survey. The U.S., as Japan's only military ally, remains the country with which the Japanese people feel the closest affinity. China is the second least friendly country after Russia.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at the changes over the past 40 years or so, it appears that as authoritarian tendencies have increased, familiarity with the country has tended to decline.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, Japanese familiarity with China was on par with that of the United States, but the gap with the U.S. widened around the time of the Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. By 2012, when Xi Jinping took office as supreme leader, the percentage of respondents who felt familiarity with China fell below 20%. The same trend applies to Russia. When the former Soviet Union collapsed, a quarter of respondents said they felt closer to Russia.</p>

        <p>Factors other than politics come to mind when looking at demographics.</p>
        <p>In East Asia, China and South Korea are the most popular countries for younger and older generations, with those in their 30s and younger saying they feel more affinity with these countries than older generations.
        When the 40+ generation were students, Japan was far ahead of these two countries in economic power, but since the turn of the 21st century, the gap between the three East Asian countries has narrowed in manufacturing and IT technology. For the younger generation, China and South Korea are not lagging behind; rather, they are economic partners of Japan.</p>

        <p>As for South Korea, nearly two-thirds of respondents under age 30 say they are familiar with the country. Younger generations in Japan are more familiar with Korean culture, including K-pop, than older generations.There are also gender differences with regard to Korea. Female respondents are 13 points more familiar with Korea than male respondents. Korean fashion and TV dramas are popular among Japanese women, suggesting that cultural exchange has an impact on national sentiment.</p>
